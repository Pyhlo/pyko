# What is this?

This is my attempt to create my first "better-looking" website, it is probably shit, but I'll still give it a try.

# Why do I make it public?

Well if anyone want to copy anything from here, change it or just use it as some kind of notes, then they can do. But I will warn people who does this: This is my first attempt, which means it's really, really bad and not optimized in any good way.

# What does the numbers means? (001, 002, 003)

It's for every try I'll try to make of a website. (All of them might not be the same)
